# SRA Tutorial
-------------------------


### Get SRA toolkit
We need to first download SRA toolkit from NCBI's website:

http://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?view=software

Select your appropriate binary distribution. For most modern Macs, MacOS 64 bit architecture would do the trick. The resulting file is ~ 51.5 mb

![toolkit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microgenomics/tutorials/master/img/sra02.png)

Double-click on sratoolkit.2.5.7-mac64.tar.gz to uncompress the file. Now you need to open a Terminal window (within Applications/Utilities/Terminal). 

![term](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microgenomics/tutorials/master/img/sra04.png)

You should see a window like the following:

![term](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microgenomics/tutorials/master/img/sra022.png)

Now you need to "navigate" to the SRA toolkit folder by issueing the following command

	cd /Users/Ed/Downloads/sratoolkit.2.5.7-mac64/bin

`cd`  indicates that you want to change directory and the rest is simply the path to the destination directory. Make sure to replace `Ed` in the path above by your own home directory name. To confirm you are where you are suppossed to type `pwd`. The Terminal should return your current location, i.e., `/Users/Ed/Downloads/sratoolkit.2.5.7-mac64/bin`
Lastly, type `./fastq-dump -h` to see the help menu.

### Get SRA data

Next, we need to download actual data. We will use a somewhat small file hosted at SRA under the accession `SRR3171211`. Issue the following command in order to download the data:

	./fastq-dump --accession SRR3171211 --outdir my_outdir
where `SRR3171211` is the file we want and `my_outdir` is simply an arbitrary name for the output directory

![dump](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microgenomics/tutorials/master/img/sra05.png)

and voil√†! You should see a file named `SRR3171211.fastq` inside the output directory (takes about 10 minutes; 111.5 mb)
